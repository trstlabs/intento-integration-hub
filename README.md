# Intento Integration Hub

Welcome to the **Intento Integration Hub** ‚Äî your starting point for exploring how to integrate with Intento.

This repository contains real-world integration examples and client scripts for working with Intento-powered flows across the interchain ecosystem. Whether you're building on Cosmos, EVM, or another stack, these examples are designed to be plug-and-play.

## ‚ú® What's Inside

Each folder in this repo represents an integration, which can include:

- üìÅ Example scripts to trigger or listen to Intento flows
- üìò TypeScript code with typed client helpers
- üîç Usage notes and integration-specific considerations

| Integration | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `ai-agents` | Prototype integration for a knowledge base agent for intent-based flows ‚Äî exploring autonomous orchestration. |
| `autocompound-dydx` | Early-stage workaround for auto-compounding DYDX rewards within current Interchain Account (ICA) allowlist constraints. |
| `autocompound-elys` | Conceptual example of how auto-compounding could operate on Elys using Intento flows. |
| `streamswap` | Initial prototype for streaming token swaps ‚Äî enabling time-based DCA execution via interchain flows. |
| `tokenstream.fun` | Experimental integration using Skip API and IBC hooks to demonstrate decentralized DCA strategies across chains. |
