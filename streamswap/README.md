# StreamSwap: DCA Into a Stream

This guide outlines how to integrate a **DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)** feature into a StreamSwap stream. It includes technical flows, UX patterns, and code references to streamline implementation across different blockchains.

## ✨ Idea: Early Pledge Unlocks DCA

Participants who **pledge early** (e.g. 50 ATOM or 200 USDC) before a stream starts unlock the ability to **DCA into the stream**. Once unlocked, these participants can continue to add funds gradually over time, as the sale progresses. They get the benefit of **purchasing tokens at different price points**, mitigating risk from price swings during the stream.

### **Unique Value Proposition:**

This approach is valuable both for stream owners and participants:

#### **For Stream Owners:**

1. **Increased Initial Commitment**
2. **Longer Participation & Continued Engagement**
3. **Predictable Stream Dynamics**
4. **Attractive Offer for Participants**

#### **For Participants (Early Subscribers):**

1. **Risk Mitigation with DCA**
2. **Flexibility in Investment**
3. **Potential Better Allocation**
4. **Incentivized Participation**

### **Potential Benefits of the Strategy:**

1. **Increased Liquidity for the Stream**
2. **More Balanced Token Distribution**
3. **Attracts a Larger Pool of Participants**
4. **Enhanced User Engagement**

## Initiating the Flow from the UI

A **“Start DCA” button** can be enabled in the frontend once the early pledge is complete. Clicking this triggers the flow on Intento via a `MsgTransfer` with a `flow` memo.

> **Pro tip:** Instead of manually building and submitting transactions, StreamSwap can leverage our **Submit Page** for easy flow initiation.
> This page abstracts all the complexity and guides the user through submitting flows with minimal friction.

Integration-ready scripts and examples:

- `dca_hosted_ica.sh` – Bash: Trustless Agent setup
- `dca_self-hosted_ica.sh` – Bash: Self-Trustless Agent setup
- `dca_hosted_ica.ts` – TypeScript: Trustless Agent with `MsgExec` support for optimal UX

### **Technical Options for DCA Integration**

| **Method**                   | **DCA** | **Withdraw** | **Needs ICA Funding?** | **Complexity** | **UX Quality** | **Notes**                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. ICA (user-owned)**      | ✅      | ✅           | ✅                     | Medium         | ❌ Poor        | Requires pre-setup ICA address. Currently not compatible with Authz on Osmosis.                        |
| **2. IBC Hooks (user addr)** | ✅      | ❌           | ❌                     | Low            | ✅ Good        | Uses user's Osmosis address. Requires smart contract for proper handling.                              |
| **3. ICA + ICQ**             | ✅      | ✅           | ✅                     | 🔺 High        | ❌ Poor        | Uses interchain accounts with queries to track remote balances. Complex.                               |
| **4. Trustless Agent + MsgExec**  | ✅      | ✅           | ❌                     | ✅ Low         | ✅✅ Excellent | Easiest user experience. Requires MsgExec support from Osmosis. Supported on the Injective blockchain. |

### Self-Trustless Agent Flow

1. Create the ICA on Intento chain.
2. Subscribe to the stream using the ICA address as operator.
3. Send funds with `flow` memo to Intento with MsgExecuteContract as a message, auto-parsing the ICA operator.

**Notes:**

- ICA must be pre-created and funded by the user.
- Works on any ICA-supporting chain but adds user friction.

### Trustless Agent Flow

1. Create a flow on Intento via a `flow` memo in a `MsgTransfer` from the host chain.
2. Use a **hosted interchain account** to manage host chain fees.
3. Execute actions with `MsgExec` via AuthZ permissions, which can be signed and broadcast in the same transaction for better UX. This is the recommended approach and is part of the Intento Portal Submit Page UX.

**Notes:**

- No user-side ICA setup or funding needed.
- Better UX but requires trust in the hosted operator.
- Full AuthZ support for ICAs required, currently not available on Osmosis.
- On Intento, hosted accounts only execute messages signed by you. See [Intento Auth Documentation](https://docs.intento.zone/module/authentication) for details.
